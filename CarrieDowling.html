          Hi there! I'm Carrie Dowling and currently 
          a full stack web development student 
          at the University of Denver (Go Pios!). 
          I have a Master of Science in Information 
          and Communication Sciences from Ball State
          University and a Bachelor of Arts 
          in Mass Communication from Purdue University. 
          <br>
          <br>
          In my spare time I enjoy photography, hiking 
          with my dog, volunteering with animals, and 
          figuring out what a "div tag" is.  
          I'm interested in becoming a front end web 
          developer and eventually becoming an app developer.
